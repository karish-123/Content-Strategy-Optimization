# Content Strategy Optimization

## Overview

This project analyzes content performance data for Streamly, a streaming platform, to optimize content strategy and improve user retention. The analysis focuses on understanding the factors that contribute to content success and user engagement.

## Project Description

This is a comprehensive data science analysis that examines a dataset of 800,000 content entries to identify patterns and relationships that drive content success on streaming platforms. The project includes:

- **Data Exploration & Cleaning**: Comprehensive analysis of content metadata, performance metrics, and user engagement data
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation analysis, outlier detection, and feature importance analysis
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive modeling for user retention and content success
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs to illustrate key insights
- **Strategy Recommendations**: Data-driven recommendations for content acquisition and promotion

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following key features:

### Content Metadata
